# team5 HP Milestone 3

Denny
Navbar 
*make search bar take you somewhere*
Homepage
Footer

Calvin
Deliverer main menu
*Practice reusable components. So pass all details that would differ between users as a parameter/prop*
 - no performance or review or list of completed orders needed
 - There is instead only an int of how many orders this deliverer completed. So show this somehow but with a made up number for now

John
Restaurant page for customers
*this is not in the mockup, but we need it*
*This one is fine if you make just one page with hard coded values. The real one would probably make a queryto our API after being passed a restaurant id as a parameter but we don’t have an API yet.*
 - Once a customer clicks a restaurant they see this and the restaurant’s menu
 - People are able to click a button to add food to cart (we don’t have a cart for now so make this button do nothing)

Huan
*These will all look similar. Once a person clicks submit just make that button do nothing right now.*
User, Restaurant, Deliverer Sign up
User, Restaurant, Deliverer Log in

Marco
*Practice reusable components: A good one to use here is a reusable order card thing and you pass it the details over props in react which are basically parameters*
*Have one of each page. The reusable component here would be those cards with the order details. We don’t have a way to login right now so we can’t have different pages for each user yet.*
Restaurant order page
Delivery order page

Bryan
Restaurant menu add
 - add a button that loads their menu and gives them an option to edit
